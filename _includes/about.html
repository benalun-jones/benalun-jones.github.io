                <img class= "mePic" src="../img/WebsitePic.jpg">
                <p>I am an aspiring Web Developer based in London.  Over the past three months I attended General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Immersive</a> course, learning and applying the skills needed to launch a career as a Developer.</p> 
                <p>Before joining GA, I finished my degree in Geography, whilst attempting to surround myself with startups in the workplace during time off.</p>
                <p>I am currently working hard to keep up and enhance the skills I learnt during my time at GA, offering freelance services to friends and family on personal projects of theirs.</p>
                <p>What I would really like, though, is a full time position, continuing my educational journey in a working environment, with a particular focus on developing my JavaScript skills.</p>
