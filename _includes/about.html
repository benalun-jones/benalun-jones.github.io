                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Friends of mine often ask why I decided to re-enter education just as I gained full independence following university studies - but I couldnâ€™t ignore the urge to learn how to code as I pondered what I really wanted to do. This brought me to General Assembly and its Web Development Immersive program.  I am now looking to continue this educational journey in the workplace with a particular focus on developing my Javascript skills. <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/">the preview page</a></p>
